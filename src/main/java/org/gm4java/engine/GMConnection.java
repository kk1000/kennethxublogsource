     * <p>
     * This method can be used in different ways explained in the following sections using an example of drawing text NO
     * IMAGE on a background defined by in.png.
     * <p>
     * One way is to prepare entire command line with proper space separation of GraphicsMagick arguments and pass it as
     * one single string to command parameter. You don't need to use arguments parameter at all. Using this way, you
     * need to make sure special characters are escaped and arguments with space are quoted. e.g.,
     * 
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * execute("convert in.png -draw \"text 50 100 \"\"NO IMAGE\"\"\" out.png");
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     * 
     * A better way is to pass the command and arguments separately. The same example can now be written as below.
     * Notice that you don't need to add the quotes and escape the quotes anymore.
     * 
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * execute("convert", "in.png", "-draw", "text 50 100 \"NO IMAGE\"", "out.png");
